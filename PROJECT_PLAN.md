# Recipe Card Generator - Project Development Plan

## Project Overview
A web application that allows publishers and bloggers to create structured data cards (recipes, how-to guides, FAQs) with automatic JSON-LD generation and embeddable, interactive visual cards for their websites.

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: Nuxt 3, Vue 3, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, DaisyUI
- **Backend**: Supabase (Auth, Database, Realtime)
- **Edge Infrastructure**: NuxtHub, Cloudflare Workers, KV, R2, Queues
- **Deployment**: Cloudflare Pages via NuxtHub
- **Testing**: Vitest, Playwright

## Development Methodology

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
This project follows Test-Driven Development principles:
1. **Write failing tests FIRST** - Define expected behavior before implementation
2. **Run tests to confirm they fail** - Verify tests are properly detecting missing functionality
3. **Write minimal code to make tests pass** - Implement only what's necessary
4. **Refactor if needed** - Improve code quality while keeping tests green

### Incremental Feature Development
When developing new features:
1. **Start with page scaffolding** - Create page structure first for CRUD operations (new, edit, view, delete)
2. **Build functionality piece by piece** - Add features incrementally so progress is visible
3. **Prioritize UI visibility** - Ensure each piece can be seen and navigated to as it's developed

### Continue Development Command
Use `/continue-phase` command to resume development with proper context and methodology.
