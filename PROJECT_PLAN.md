## Session Notes

### Phase 1 Implementation (2025-06-20)

**‚úÖ Completed:**
- Full authentication system with Supabase
- Normalized database schema with ingredients, instructions, supplies
- Test-driven development approach implemented
- All authentication component tests passing
- Protected routes middleware working
- Professional landing page designed
- User profile management system

**üîß Technical Decisions:**
- Using local Supabase development environment
- Normalized database schema for better ingredient indexing and affiliate product support
- TDD approach with Vitest for testing
- DaisyUI for consistent UI components

**‚ö†Ô∏è Minor Issues Resolved:**
- Fixed Supabase configuration in test environment
- Resolved module conflicts between custom plugin and @nuxtjs/supabase
- Authentication tests now passing consistently

**üìä Test Status:**
- ‚úÖ Authentication component tests: All passing
- ‚úÖ Basic database schema tests: Mostly passing  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Complex database operations: Minor edge cases with user creation timing

**üöÄ Ready for Phase 2:**
The foundation is solid and ready for building the core card builder functionality. The normalized schema will support all advanced features including ingredient indexing, affiliate products, and JSON-LD generation.
