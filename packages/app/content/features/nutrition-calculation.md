## Display nutrition values on your Create Recipe Cards for free

Create includes automatic Nutrition Calculation to registered users—for free! 

Nutrition information is a recognized field in Google's Structured Data Tool and it can be really useful for your readers. But calculating nutrition is... tedious. As with all things Schema, Create makes nutrition calculation really simple.

### List your ingredients

Add in your basic ingredients with amounts, as simply and as specifically as possible. Leave out alternative measurements, substitutions, and anything extra for now.

### Fill out servings details

Now enter the Serving Size in the Nutrition field.

You can also add the serving size (this is optional and defaults to 1).

### Calculate nutrition

Now click "Calculate" and let Create handle the tedious calculations.

Create will send your ingredients and servings information to the Create Studio API, which utilizes API Ninjas' Nutrition calculation to add up all the ingredients and find the per-serving nutritional values.

### Verify nutrition values and adjust if necessary.

Once you’re done calculating, you can go back into your ingredients list and add any extra information you want to be there for your readers - such as alternative measurements, substitutions, or other extra detailed wording.
