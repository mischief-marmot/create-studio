## Create gorgeous Recipe cards in no time

![Recipe Cards Hero](/img/features/recipe-cards-hero.jpg)

Built from the ground up with Schema benefit, performance, and optimal user experience in mind, Create Recipe Cards are ad-ready, easy to use, and optimized for SEO.

### Start with Create

If you have not used Create before, you will first want to [download](https://create.studio/plugin), install, and register your Create plugin.

## How to Create Recipe Cards

### Getting Started

If you would like to add a **new** recipe card, head to your WordPress admin side menu bar and select **Create > Add New Create Card.** You can also add a card directly to your post from the post editor.

![getting-started-1](/img/features/recipe-cards/getting-started/01.jpg)

![getting-started-2](/img/features/recipe-cards/getting-started/02.jpg)

From here, give your recipe card a title and select **Create Card**.

![getting-started-3](/img/features/recipe-cards/getting-started/03.jpg)

## Recipe Details

You can add recipe details on the left side of the screen, while a preview of your recipe card is shown on the right. Fill out these sections completely for the best performance.

![recipe-details-1](/img/features/recipe-cards/recipe-details/01.jpg)

## Ingredients

Scroll down to the next section to input the ingredients needed for your recipe. You can add your ingredients in either a bulk or detailed format. To do this, toggle between **Bulk** and **Detail**.

**Bulk format** allows you to paste all ingredients at once in a simple text format.

![ingredients-1](/img/features/recipe-cards/ingredients/01.jpg)

**Detailed format** gives you more control, allowing you to:
- Add precise quantities and measurements for each ingredient
- Organize ingredients with preparation notes
- Separate ingredients with subheadings using the **Add Group** button

![ingredients-2](/img/features/recipe-cards/ingredients/02.jpg)

While using the Detail option, you can also separate your ingredients with subheadings by using the **Add Group** button.

![ingredients-3](/img/features/recipe-cards/ingredients/03.jpg)

Your groups will display as organized sections in your recipe card.

## Instructions

Adding instructions to your recipe is straightforward. Using the **Optimize** button forces your paragraphs into ordered lists, which are recommended for SEO.

If your instructions aren't displaying in a numbered list, or if you get a notice in Google Search Console about the same issue, clicking this button should resolve that. This action **can** be undone.

![instructions-1](/img/features/recipe-cards/instructions/01.jpg)

## Video

You can add a video to your recipe card. This video can come from your Mediavine Dashboard or an external link from YouTube (Create does not support YouTube Shorts).

![video-1](/img/features/recipe-cards/video/01.jpg)

## Recommended Products

The **Recommended Products** section gives you the opportunity to add affiliate links and images straight into your recipe card. For easy access to products you have used with Create before, use the **Select Product** dropdown list.

Clicking **Process** on the product URL will scrape both the title and image from the link. If you find your image is unavailable or you would like to select a different image, you can manually upload your image.

## Nutrition

Create auto-calculates nutritional values with help from our partner API Ninjas Nutrition. This allows you to provide nutrition estimates for your recipes in a way that's convenient for you and your readers alike!

For more details on nutrition, please check out [nutrition calculation](/features/nutrition-calculation)!

![nutrition-1](/img/features/recipe-cards/nutrition/01.jpg)

## SEO & Social Media

For SEO purposes, this section gives you the opportunity to add relevant **keywords** for your recipe.

You can also link your Pinterest URL, image, and description. You only need to add a Pinterest URL if you want the pin to go to a post other than the post where you have the Create Card added. Read more details about this [here](/en/articles/8917121).

![seo--1](/img/features/recipe-cards/seo-/01.jpg)

## Utilities

**Clone Card**

Cloning your card gives you a copy of your recipe card. This option is available for reusing a card that has similar content. In order to avoid duplicate content, each card should be slightly different.

![utilities-1](/img/features/recipe-cards/utilities/01.jpg)

You can also reuse the same recipe card in multiple posts. In this case, you would not clone the card, but simply add the same card to an additional post. [Read more here](/en/articles/8916865)!

**Schema Validation**

You can use this selection to test the schema markup of your recipe card to make sure it is as optimized as possible for schema and Google search results.

![utilities-2](/img/features/recipe-cards/utilities/02.jpg)

**Print Preview**

This selection gives you the ability to view exactly how your card will look when printed.

![utilities-3](/img/features/recipe-cards/utilities/03.jpg)

**Shortcode**

Create Cards are implemented via a shortcode. From the below field, you can copy and paste this shortcode into editors that support it. For more information on how to use this shortcode, see [this article](/en/articles/8917057).

## Custom Fields

**CSS Class**

Add any additional CSS to make customizations to your recipe card, if desired.

![custom-fields-1](/img/features/recipe-cards/custom-fields/01.jpg)

**Custom Nutrition Disclaimer**

It is recommended to add a nutrition disclaimer in this field to let your readers know that nutrition values are merely estimates. You can word this disclaimer however you would like.

![custom-fields-2](/img/features/recipe-cards/custom-fields/02.jpg)

![custom-fields-3](/img/features/recipe-cards/custom-fields/03.jpg)

**Custom Affiliate Message**

If there is specific language needed for the affiliate program you use, you can add it to this section.
